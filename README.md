# Setup

Make sure you have `docker` or orbstack installed and then run `docker-compose
up -d` inside `./docker`.

## steps
1. go to `./server` and migrate the db with `npm run migrate:up`
2. I included seeds but you can freely do stuff
3. run the server with `npm start` it should go to `http://localhost:8080`
